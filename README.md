# My Career

I started to learn how to code when I was 18, to be honest it was pretty late. Learning how to code sooner help YOU a lot on your journey to become a programmer. But don't ever doubt yourself, it was never too late to learn something new or to dream a new dream. Just keep improving yourself day by day, learn hard work hard sleep hard and YOU will become successful one day sooner. STAY HARD!

- Python: <1 years (currently learning)
- Javascript: 0 years (plan)
- C++: 0 years (plan)
- Ruby: 0 years (plan)

### Recommendations

When you learn something new, you need to test it out yourself for better information and get use to it. Just like me, I test a lot of things and find out what is good for me.

For Python learners: you don't need to learn all of that. You just need to understand the basic and how to advance it.
