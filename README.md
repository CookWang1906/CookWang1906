# My Career

I started to learn how to code when I was 18, to be honest it was pretty late. Learning how to code sooner help YOU a lot on your journey to become a programmer. But don't ever doubt yourself, it was never too late to learn something new or to dream a new dream. Just keep improving yourself day by day, learn hard work hard sleep hard and YOU will become successful one day sooner. STAY HARD!
